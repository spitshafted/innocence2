<p class="p1">Welcome to “Innocence”.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Innocence is located at 949 Venice Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90015. Innocence is open to the public everyday 11am-5pm.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is free street parking available.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Innocence is a contemporary art gallery with a heavy focus/intent on allocating collective personal resources between the audience and the designers in highlighting absolutely beautiful found happenings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">It is a bit post-storefront, there could potentially be purchases to be made (at whose final cost?), but cash is of no essence - our human rights are indeed far more important to all of us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Humanely trafficked goods scattered in these found happenings is exactly what threads the needle in creating an art gallery of true Innocence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Everything held dearest to Innocence is within frame now. Love always finds a way.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Can we be dehumanized any longer, collectively? We only rely on cruciality, impedance, and solitude.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Innocence is announcing a full month of adjacent space activations for April (every Saturday and Sunday) - further details can only be inferred by their titles at this juncture of writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Seek peace in that alone. Flyers will be uploaded in due time, could even be after the fact.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">There is no false movement here, there is no false art, there is only but the purest resilience and Innocence.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
